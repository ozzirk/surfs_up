# surfs_up
**Overview**

The purpose of this analysis is to establish if a surf and icecream business in Oahu would have the proper weather to sustain consistent business, or if it happens to trand more seasonally. To analyze this, we have sampled data from June and December to compare differences. 

**Results**

There were three key differences noted between the months of June and December:
1. The mean, or average temperature in June was 74.9 degrees versus December, which had an average of 71.04
2. The amount of datapoints available for each month varied as well, which could illustrate missing data. June had 1,700 entries meanwhile December only had 1,517
3. Standard deviations of both data sets were fairly similar, however. June showed slightly more consistency with 3.25 std, whereas December had 3.75

**Summary**

Overall, the data between June and December supports a fairly consistent weather pattern from summer months to winter months. To further investigate this, I would like to include some additional analyses before making a final recommendation. 
1. Bring in rainfall data to see if there are rainy seasons that may impact the flow of customers
2.  Look at temperatures on a line chart by month to make sure we haven't accidentally missed any anomalies by only looking at data from June and December
